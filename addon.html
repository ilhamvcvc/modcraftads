    <h1>Addon Mod Installation</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you have downloaded an Addon Mod that is compatible with your Minecraft PE version. Check if the mod supports your Minecraft PE version to avoid conflicts or errors.</li>
      <li>Open the Minecraft PE application on your device.</li>
      <li>Open the game world where you want to add the Addon Mod or create a new world.</li>
      <li>Exit the game world and go back to the main Minecraft PE screen.</li>
      <li>Open the File Manager application on your device. If your device doesn't have a built-in File Manager app, you can download and use third-party apps like "ES File Explorer" or "Solid Explorer".</li>
      <li>Locate the Addon Mod file that you previously downloaded. Usually, Addon Mod files have the .mcaddon or .mcpack extension.</li>
      <li>Double-tap on the Addon Mod file. Minecraft PE will automatically recognize the file and start the installation process.</li>
      <li>Wait for a few moments until the installation is complete. After the installation is finished, you will see a confirmation message indicating that the Addon Mod has been successfully installed.</li>
      <li>Go back to the Minecraft PE app and enter the game world where you want to play with the Addon Mod.</li>
      <li>When starting the game world, you will see that the Addon Mod has been applied and can be used in the game.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure to always back up your game worlds and Minecraft PE files before installing Addon Mods to avoid data loss. Also, ensure that you check the source of the Addon Mod you download to verify its authenticity and avoid potentially harmful mods.</p>
